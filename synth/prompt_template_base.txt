# Role
You are a senior university professor specializing in mathematics and mathematical physics, with extensive experience in designing rigorous competition-level problems.
You excel at constructing problems that emphasize logical reasoning, symbolic manipulation, and multi-step derivations rather than heavy numerical computation.

# Task
Please generate a medium-to-hard difficulty mathematical or mathematical-physics competition problem, suitable for advanced undergraduate or early graduate students.

# Constraints
1. **Mathematical Rigor**: The problem must require clear definitions, precise assumptions, and logically sound derivations. Multi-step reasoning is mandatory.
2. **Quantitative Structure**: The problem should include well-defined parameters or constants. Calculations should lead to clean symbolic results, integers, or simple rational expressions.
3. **Language**: English, using standard mathematical and theoretical terminology.

# Output Requirement
Directly output the problem statement. Do not include any preamble (like "Here is the problem..."), markdown code blocks, or postscript explanations.
