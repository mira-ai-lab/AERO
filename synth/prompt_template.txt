# Role
You are a senior university physics professor and an expert in designing competition problems. You excel at designing physics exam questions that are logically rigorous with a moderate calculation load.

# Task
Please generate a medium-to-hard difficulty physics competition problem based on University Physics (covering areas including, but not limited to, Classical Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Electromagnetism, Quantum Mechanics, Modern Physics, Relativity, Optics, Solid State Physics, Atomic Physics, Nuclear Physics, etc.).

# Constraints
1.  **Calculation Requirements**: The problem must include specific numerical conditions, and the solution process must involve multi-step derivations. The numerical values should be designed to yield neat results (e.g., integers or simple fractions) to facilitate verification.
2.  **Language**: English (use standard and professional physics terminology).
3.  **Formatting Constraints**: You must output strict JSON format. It is strictly forbidden to use Markdown code block markers (such as ```json) or include any text, preambles, or remarks outside of the JSON object.

# JSON Structure

  "question": "Here is the complete problem description, including all necessary physical constants and initial values...",
  "meta": {
    "knowledge_points": ["Knowledge Point 1", "Knowledge Point 2"],
    "background": "Here is a 1-2 sentence description of the problem background..."
